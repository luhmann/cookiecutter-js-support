# Cookiecutter JS Support

This is a very barebone boilerplate for new JS/Node-projects which provides:

* `.eslintrc` with working linting
* `.editorconfig`
* `.nvmrc`
* `.gitignore`
* `package.json`
* Minimal folder structure
* Minimal test setup

## Quick Start
Install [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter):
```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

or if you do not want to setup a python stack:

```bash
brew install cookiecutter
```

Scaffold your project:
```
cookiecutter gh:luhmann/cookiecutter-js-support
```


Could have been done with yeoman, but thats verbose
